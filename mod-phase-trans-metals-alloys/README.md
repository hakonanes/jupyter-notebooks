# TMT4260 Modelling of Phase Transformations in Metals and Alloys
Notebooks answering questions posed in assignments in the TMT4260 course of fall 2017 at NTNU, Norway. The assignments are made by Knut Marthinsen and Ã˜ystein Grong at NTNU.

### tmt4260_exercise1.ipynb
Check the validity of Stirling's formula and calculate the lattice heat capacity for copper using the Einstein and Debye models, the free energy of mixing for regular solutions at constant temperatures and the phase-border (solvus line) between a single- and two-phase region.

### tmt4260_exercise2.ipynb
Plot parts of phase diagrams after solving a pair of nonlinear equations using the `scipy.optimize.root` algorithm with the Levenberg-Marquardt method.
